## IPFN Rootchain

This document is a seed for [IPFN](https://github.com/ipfn) root chain.

## What is it?

Rootchain is a [Parity](https://www.parity.io) powered globally accessible blockchain.

## Functions

Rootchain serves as global and secure identity provider and EVM execution platform with single globally available truth for the [IPFN](https://github.com/ipfn) public network.

### Cryptocurrency

Value of a currency or the price of thereof is only that which people are willing to pay or give in exchange for it.

There is no promise of the service which will be provided for the token itself which is out of our control.

## Purpose

What is the purpose of another Ethereum blockchain and why not develop a new one?

The purpose of rootchain is not to develop a new blockchain software but a network.

## Principles

Before the distribution of tokens is over (not staking) there always exists a slight probability that private keys which hold genesis tokens are compromised, in this case we will most probably fork and rollback the blockchain. After the distribution is over and community operated validator nodes are in-place we can only advise and mining power or voting will decide, after the Proof-of-Stake is complete.

## Distribution

Tokens will be distributed across the world to individuals which are able to confirm their unique identity using different mechanisms (twitter, sms, photo etc.).

Part of the issued tokens will remain a part of rootchain fund which is used to fund IPFN projects development.

Precise parameters of the distribution remain undefined until direct or indirect interest in the token itself is measured.

## Validating

Rootchain validators are currently all operated by rootchain organization members but we are looking for trusted parties to further decentralize the whole network.

We are anxiously awaiting the release of [Casper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09437) to enable validating and generating tokens by all of the community.

## Roadmap

There is no roadmap per se which would indicate that work needs to be done on our end to further advance the blockchain software, which is not true.

Plans for this blockchain development include following:

1. Deploy sharding after it's tested
2. Deploy Casper Proof-of-Stake validating protocol as it's proven to operate without downtime
3. Keep developing IPFN protocol and software

## Details

### Block time

Time between blocks should be between 5 and 6 seconds, no more and certainly no less.

### Mining fees

Proof-of-Work is not required to mine a new block but every single block still creates 1 new token.

Tokens created by validators that are operated by rootchain organization are partially transferred back to the rootchain fund and partially kept in hot-wallets serving as _bounties_.

### Validator nodes

Currently running a validator node is not possible if you are outside of rootchain organization. This will change soon after Casper is released and tested.

### Transaction fees

Currently there are zero transaction fees but we will forceed steps in order to protect our nodes and then entire blockchain from the possibility of spam attacks.
Because of this reason, most certainly it will change in the near future.

## Public blockchain

Definition of a public blockchain in _cryptocurrency_ world would be that everyone can run a validating node.

Currently the blockchain is operated by mechanism called Proof-of-Authority where authorities are independent members of rootchain organization and associates. It is in fact similar to [XRP](https://ripple.com/xrp/) or [IOTA](https://www.iota.org) situation but in this case it's considered incubator.

We stay committed and look forward to the day rootchain is completely public and validated outside of bounds of our organization.
